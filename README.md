Caress is a revolutionary mental health app designed to streamline therapy processes and promote holistic well-being. Our proprietary psychological model, the Caress Model, empowers therapists to assess their patients' mental health efficiently, track progress, and make informed treatment decisions. At the same time, it offers users a platform to understand and manage their emotions, connect with therapists, and access support through an AI chatbot.

- **Mood Tracker:** Users can track their mood and emotions regularly, gaining better self-awareness and understanding their emotional patterns.

- **Weekly Mental Health Assessment:** Users can participate in weekly mental health assessments based on the Caress Model, allowing them to monitor their progress and well-being.

- **Find a Therapist:** Users can search for therapists and easily contact them to book a session, promoting accessibility to mental health services.

- **AI Chatbot:** The app features an AI-powered chatbot that provides a confidential platform for users to discuss their concerns when speaking to a person is challenging.
